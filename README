This is an on-screen chat system for fullscreen presentations.

Currently it does not contain the chat component, only OSD output of
text strings using Gtk & Cairo.

It also does not work on Windows as expected because Gtk on Windows
does not support alpha transparency.

And I did not even test on Mac OS X.
