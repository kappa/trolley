This is an on-screen chat system for fullscreen presentations.

Currently it uses FriendFeed as a message bus.

OSD output of text strings is implemented using Gtk & Cairo.

It does not work on Windows as expected because Gtk on Windows
does not support alpha transparency.

I did not even test on Mac OS X.
